\description{
R implementation of the SWATS optimizer proposed
by Shekar and Sochee (2018).
We used the implementation available at
https://github.com/jettify/pytorch-optimizer/
Thanks to Nikolay Novik for providing the pytorch code.

From the abstract by the paper by Shekar and Sochee (2018):
Adaptive optimization methods such as Adam, Adagrad or RMSprop
have been found to generalize poorly compared to
Stochastic gradient descent (SGD). These methods tend to perform well i
in the initial portion of training but are outperformed by SGD at
later stages of training. We investigate a hybrid strategy that begins
training with an adaptive method and switches to SGD
when a triggering condition is satisfied.
The condition we propose relates to the projection of Adam
steps on the gradient subspace. By design, the monitoring process
for this condition adds very little overhead and does not increase
the number of hyperparameters in the optimizer.
